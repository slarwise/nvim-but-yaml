# nvim but yaml

Configure neovim using yaml.

## Features

- [ ] Validate against json schema
- [ ] Completion using schema
- [ ] Plugin that reads the yaml configuration and configures neovim accordingly

## Questions

- [ ] How do we configure plugins? Should it be done separately somehow? Hard to
  validate it.
- [ ] How to keep indentation minimal? Should each language be a top-level key?
